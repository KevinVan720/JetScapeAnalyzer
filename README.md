# JetScapeAnalyzer

This repo contains the analysis code for analyzing JETSCAPE final hadron output files. 

The important classes are contained in analysis.py:

Particle is the class of hadrons. 

JetScapeReader is the class for parsing final hadron files generated by JETSCAPE. It supports different header styles. Header is the line that starts with "#" indicating a new event in the final hadron file. You can read the header inside the hadron file, or reading it from a separate header file. (Because when doing multiple hadronization in JETSCAPE, we can not use pythia to generate the cross sections. We have to use the standalone header file generated when running sub_to_run.py). 

AnalysisBase is the base class for all subsequent analysis. The only assumptions is the hadron files read in are organized by different pThat bins. 

You can read all the actual analysis derived from AnalysisBase. This analysis framework is written to be as flexible as possible. 

One thing to notice is that this analysis framework requires the heppy library in python to analyze jets. You can build a docker container using the AnalysisContainer folder. Then bind the input and output folder to /home/input and /home/output. The GRID and NERSC folder contains scripts that I used to actually submit the analysis jobs on the WSU grid and NERSC. Specifically, you can use the docker image docker:wenkaifan/jetscape_analyzer:latest that I have built on NERSC.
